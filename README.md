# Fellowship.ai CV challenge 

This repository consists of two notebooks: one dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where the Oxford's 102 Flowers dataset characteristics and properties are examined, and another focused on model building for the Fellowship.ai Computer Vision challenge, where a deep learning model based on ResNet50 is trained through Transfer Learning, using the insights gained from the EDA.
